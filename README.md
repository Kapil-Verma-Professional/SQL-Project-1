Project Title: Global COVID-19 Analysis: Tracking Deaths and Vaccination Trends

Project Overview: In this comprehensive data-driven project, I delve into a thorough analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Through meticulous Data collection, calculation, aggregation, and analysis, this project uncovers critical insights into the impact of the virus and the progress of vaccination efforts across the world.

Project Objectives: The project is designed to achieve the following objectives:
- Determine the total COVID-19 cases and population of each country.
- Calculate the percentage of deaths in each country and identify those with the highest death rates.
- Compare countries with the highest cases relative to their population.
- Identify countries with the highest total COVID-19 deaths.
- Analyze infection rates by continent, identifying the most affected regions.
- Track the global number of COVID-19 deaths over time.
- Integrate COVID-19 vaccination data to understand vaccination trends.
- Perform data joins, using both Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables, to combine vital datasets.
- Create a view to store aggregated data for future visualization.
